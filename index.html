                    <p>
                        I have got a task: to develop an algorithm that capable to draw graphs are on a rectangular grid. One of requirements of is that clusters be clearly visible. An <a href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/9/2036.full#F1">algorithm for automatic drawing of biochemical networks</a> is a basis of offers. I have carried out it, you can see it <a href=https://github.com/Znbiz/HelikarLab/tree/master/Grid%20layout%20algorithm/Variant%202>here</a>. However we had to refuse to this algorithm because his operating speed on graphs with the number of vertices is more than 10 exp fall. This happened by reason of that the algorithm was based on a complicated enumeration method.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I suggested to go away from this method and to develop my own. My option was a search of a special number for each vertex, which would be allow for one pass the vertices at a certain distance from each other. This number has become the number of optimal ways extending through the top. Below you can see the advantages and disadvantages of this approach, and I will present some examples of the algorithm.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Advantages: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>On small graphs of (<= 100 vertices) are clearly visible clusters</li>
                            <li>On the several orders of magnitude faster than algorithms, which also draws on the gridе</li>
                            <li>Simple to understanding</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Disadvantages: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Very slow if the graph more than ~ 200 nodes. As compared with the force algorithm</li>
                            <li>In some graphs of bad is the division of clusters</li>

                        <br/>
                        The algorithm has adopted, but it has not embedded in the library because Graphs with the number of vertices of> 1000 browser hangs for a long time. I have a hypothesis about how to improve my algorithm quality and speed of, but it will take more time.

                        Now the library <a href="https://github.com/helikarlab/ccNetViz">ccNetViz</a> draws signatures of vertices in one texture. It makes the rendering of the text with increasing the graph slower, and it also does not give an opportunity to work with a variety of effects for text.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To achieve the goal, it was decided to split task into several ones of subproblems.

                            <li> 
                                To develop a generator SDF text, more accurate SDF atlas. What is the SDF you can find out from the article <a href="http://www.valvesoftware.com/publications/2007/SIGGRAPH2007_AlphaTestedMagnification.pdf">Improved Alpha-Tested Magnification for Vector Textures and Special Effects</a>. It is important to realize this algorithm such a way that it will work on the client side.

                            <li>
                                To make the display of text that its texture is created for each symbol. It means that drawing of each symbol is separate.

                        SDF implements a simple algorithm in pure JavaScript to get the results which could not be incorporated into ccNetViz library. Since the processing time atlas containing 250 symbols occupied a more than 10 seconds. After I have made a suggestion to make all the calculations algoritma using WebGL The result of this decisions was the reduction in the processing time of the atlas 250 symbols to a few tenths of a second ~ 0.6 seconds. A working generator SDF is below.

                        I have suggestion that the quality atlas of drawing on the client side can be improved. In order to optimize and improvement of SDF algorithm WebGL can take long, because nobody implemented this algorithm on WebGL before. We have many ways to develop :)
